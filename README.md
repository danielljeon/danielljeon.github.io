## Full Projects

### Nerve: 6-DOF Flight Controls

ðŸš€ Nerve is a general-purpose controller designed for six degrees of freedom
(6-DOF) operation. Originally developed for jet vane rocket controls, it now
serves as a testbed for robotics and controls development.

Firmware:

- [nerve](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve): Firmware for CAN-based control
  systems dev platform.

Hardware:

- [nerve_pcb](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_pcb): PCB for CAN-based
  control systems dev platform.
- [nerve_gps_pcb](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_gps_pcb): GPS module to
  `nerve_pcb`.
- [nerve_radio_pcb](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_radio_pcb): Radio and
  power supply module to `nerve_pcb`.


- [nerve_ada_board](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_ada_board): Nerve dev
  board using off-the-shelf modules.

Additional Software/Hardware:

- [gopher](https://github.com/danielljeon/gopher): Ground station for Nerve
  controller system.
    - Previously a Python desktop application for telemetry via XBee radios.
