## Full Projects

### Nerve: 6-DOF Flight Controls

ðŸš€ Nerve is a general-purpose controller designed for six degrees of freedom
(6-DOF) operation. Originally developed for jet vane rocket controls, it now
serves as a testbed for robotics and controls development.

Firmware:

- [nerve](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve): Nerve controls development
  platform.

Hardware:

- [nerve_pcb](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_pcb): Production optimized
  PCB for the STM32 based nerve controller firmware.
- [nerve_gps_pcb](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_gps_pcb): GPS
  board-to-board module for `nerve_pcb`.
- [nerve_radio_pcb](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_radio_pcb): XBee radio
  board-to-board module for `nerve_pcb`.


- [nerve_ada_board](https://github.com/danielljeon/nerve_ada_board): Nerve
  controller dev board using off-the-shelf modules, made in KiCad with KiBot
  workflows.

Additional Software:

- [gopher](https://github.com/danielljeon/gopher): Python based radio and
  telemetry desktop app for XBee radios.
